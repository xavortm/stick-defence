# Stick Defence

A rebuild of the popular Flash game from a few years back when Flash was popular. It is no longer supported and noone really uses it apart from some railway companies, but that's a different story... What's more important is that I kinda liked this game when I was about 10 years old and I wanted to bring it back and play. But this time, I have the freedom to change it how I like it ^^

Currently, it's in development, so there is no demo or a way to play it as I too can't really play it. I hope that in the coming month or so the game would work and it will be hosted on Vercel with a demo link below.

^ This is how the original Flash game looked like. I would love to have a skin that makes it look like that, but overall it would be a bit more custom design.

## It's a pet project to learn

I've picked this as a learning project actually, so some decisions are not ideal. I kinda think that the app would've been better without TypeScript for starters as it's rather small in scale and TS delayed most of the progress quite a lot (due to lack of understanding from my side). The good part is that there is some type safety now ^^

## Testing?

I haven't written tests before really, so this will also be part of the learning project here. Still, gotta research more on that. I will go to the testing phase of the build once I have the core gameplay down as I am constantly changing small things here and there.

## Contributing

If by chance you end up on this project, keep in mind that it's too early for any kind of contributions. I would love to get help once the core gameplay is working and the game is hosted for public use. Until then it's mostly a personal side project. Any notes on code quality or approaches however are welcomed!
